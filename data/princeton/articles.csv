"Princeton celebrates 25 years of research and teaching at Mpala, Kenya","This year, Princeton University is celebrating its 25th anniversary of research, teaching and collaboration at the Mpala Research Centre in Laikipia County, Kenya, while looking toward deepening engagement for the future.

Mpala, an independent Kenyan nonprofit, comprises 48,000 acres of privately owned conservation lands managed by the University in partnership with the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museums of Kenya and the Kenya Wildlife Service.

“Mpala is one of the world’s leading field-based research centers for the study of ecology, conservation, public health and sustainable development,” said Aly Kassam-Remtulla, vice provost for international affairs and operations (acting). “It offers a unique opportunity for Kenyan and international scholars to conduct experiments on a landscape scale. It also has unique resources including the first field-based genomics laboratory in Africa. As we mark our silver anniversary, we see opportunities for greater engagement of Princeton students and scholars, African scientists and conservationists, and many other neighbors and partners in the Laikipia region.” Watch a documentary on Mpala.

Mpala comprises 48,000 acres of conserved land in Laikipia County, Kenya.

A portion of the reserve is devoted to grazing lands for small-scale ranchers and farmers in the surrounding communities to raise cash and subsistence crops.

The wildlife-human connection is a crucial area of engagement for the center, where large-scale field experiments happen alongside educational experiences that bring together Princeton and Kenyan students.

“What goes on in Mpala exemplifies perfectly what we aim at here at Princeton, which is a seamless blending of teaching and research with faculty and students working together,” Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber said in a recent documentary about Mpala. “One of the genuinely special things about Mpala is the way that it takes students out of the world that they’ve known and exposes them to things that are utterly different, and some of that is about what it means to do research on the ground in a place unlike where they’ve been before.”

The vision for Mpala is to deepen the work in science and conservation, further engage scholars in the humanities, social sciences and engineering, and to boost education, research and engagement opportunities for Kenyans and scientists from other parts of Africa. To help support these initiatives, the infrastructure of the site also will need to be enhanced, such as adding solar panels, water collection, storage and treatment systems, additional laboratory infrastructure, and enhanced high-speed internet access.

“I see a future of Mpala where we robustly engage in solving the problems that we face, whether in Africa or globally, by bringing the brilliance and passion and curiosity of students and scientists from around the world to really make a difference,” said Dino Martins, Mpala’s executive director who is also a lecturer and visiting research scholar in ecology and evolutionary biology.

Princeton students interested in conservation, ecology, biology and anthropology have long benefited from the chance to study at Mpala as part of courses or for research projects.

Dan Rubenstein (center), Princeton’s Class of 1877 Professor of Zoology and professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, has had a long association with Mpala. His research on the endangered Grévy’s zebra has shown that the animals benefit livestock by eating the rough grass stems and seeds that cattle cannot digest, despite the widely held belief that the zebras compete with livestock for scarce food resources.

“Teaching in the field is completely different from teaching on campus,” said Dan Rubenstein, the Class of 1877 Professor of Zoology and professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the Program in Environmental Studies, who has had an extensive association with Mpala. “When they [students] come to a field setting, it’s total immersion from dawn ’til way after dusk. And we become partners in generating knowledge.”

In 1989, George Small of the Class of 1943 approached the University about establishing a research center on the large ranch he inherited from his brother. Since then, Princeton faculty and students have studied biodiversity, climate change, conservation, ecology, water use and other topics in partnership with local scientists and residents. Mpala is a dynamic ecosystem with arid grasslands as well as lush riverside woodlands, where researchers can study environmental pressures and the impacts of climate change. Such findings can help inform regional governments and organizations about measures to help protect the environment in East Africa and beyond.

Further, Mpala helps build connections with the wider community through education as well as efforts such as a county-wide rabies vaccination program for dogs, with the goal of eradicating this deadly disease from the landscape, protecting people, livestock and wildlife. Residents also have actively participated in the center’s research. A particularly illustrative example is the “Great Grévy’s Rally,” in which Rubenstein and other scientists engaged volunteers to spot the endangered Grévy’s zebra to learn more about its population and range.

Scientific research at Mpala spans numerous endeavors, including studying how termite mounds store nutrients and moisture, thus helping prevent the spread of deserts; using DNA to learn how multiple species of plant-eating animals can coexist in the same habitat with the same food sources, with implications for conservation; and how wildlife and cattle can be partners, not enemies, in the search for food, which could help stem the encroachment of cattle ranching on wildlife habitat.

Raised in Kenya, Kennedy Saitoti Omufwoko studied in Mpala and at the University of Nairobi before coming to Princeton to pursue a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology. He’s building on his research on ecological perspectives on bees.

“Mpala is a very big shaping part of my life. It’s where I really gathered a lot of my research experience,” Saitoti said. “I’m studying the evolution of social behavior in bees. … Princeton offered one of those labs that actually was looking into that. It was a perfect match for me.”

The possibilities for learning at Mpala extend to Princeton students no matter their academic concentrations. For example, the Holly and Henry Wendt, Class of 1955, Global Seminar, “Documentary Filmmaking in Kenya: Visual Storytelling on Wildlife and Wildlands Conservation,” invited undergraduates to shoot short films. Additionally, the anthropology course “Human Evolution” has visited Mpala to study the local culture and how humans have interacted with the wildlife and climate in the area for thousands of years.

Paula Kahumbu, who grew up in Kenya, earned her Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology from Princeton in 2002. She visited Mpala as a graduate student and now teaches at the center and leads conservation efforts in Kenya as CEO of the nonprofit WildlifeDirect.

“There was no center, we camped by the riverside, we cooked our own meals, we slept in little pup tents, and it was amazing,” Kahumbu said of her first visit. “The place was teeming with wildlife. Since then it’s been really exciting to see how it’s blossomed into this international institution that is providing a base for African scientists who can interact with scientists all over the world.”

After graduating from Princeton in 2017 with a degree in ecology and evolutionary biology, Zoe Sims spent a year at Mpala on a Princeton in Africa fellowship. “As human beings, we are part of our ecosystems, everywhere we are,” she said. “I find that being here at Mpala, in Kenya, I’m more acutely aware of that fact — partly because every morning I wake up to the sound of guinea fowl in the bushes outside my room, and many days I go to sleep at night to the sound of hyenas in the distance calling to each other,” she said. “All of these things are just these reminders that I am part of nature.”

Anniversary events were held at Mpala in June, Princeton this November, and are forthcoming in Chicago, Florida, London and Nairobi."
Princeton Univeristy,"Princeton University is a private Ivy League research university in Princeton, New Jersey. Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the College of New Jersey, Princeton is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[8][a] The institution moved to Newark in 1747, then to the current site nine years later, and renamed itself Princeton University in 1896.[13]

Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.[14] It offers professional degrees through the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture and the Bendheim Center for Finance. The university has ties with the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton Theological Seminary and the Westminster Choir College of Rider University.[b] Princeton has the largest endowment per student in the United States.[15] From 2001 to 2018, Princeton University was ranked either first or second among national universities by U.S. News & World Report, holding the top spot for 16 of those 18 years.[16]

As of October 2019, 68 Nobel laureates, 15 Fields Medalists and 13 Turing Award laureates have been affiliated with Princeton University as alumni, faculty members or researchers. In addition, Princeton has been associated with 21 National Medal of Science winners, 5 Abel Prize winners, 5 National Humanities Medal recipients, 209 Rhodes Scholars, 139 Gates Cambridge Scholars and 126 Marshall Scholars.[17] Two U.S. Presidents, twelve U.S. Supreme Court Justices (three of whom currently serve on the court) and numerous living billionaires and foreign heads of state are all counted among Princeton's alumni body. Princeton has also graduated many prominent members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Cabinet, including eight Secretaries of State, three Secretaries of Defense, three of the past five Chairs of the Federal Reserve and the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."
History,"New Light Presbyterians founded the College of New Jersey in 1746 in order to train ministers.[18] The college was the educational and religious capital of Scottish Presbyterian America. In 1754, trustees of the College of New Jersey suggested that, in recognition of Governor Jonathan Belcher's interest, Princeton should be named as Belcher College. Belcher replied: ""What a name that would be!""[19] In 1756, the college moved its campus to Princeton, New Jersey. Its home in Princeton was Nassau Hall, named for the royal House of Orange-Nassau of William III of England.

Following the untimely deaths of Princeton's first five presidents, John Witherspoon became president in 1768 and remained in that office until his death in 1794. During his presidency, Witherspoon shifted the college's focus from training ministers to preparing a new generation for secular leadership in the new American nation. To this end, he tightened academic standards and solicited investment in the college.[20] Witherspoon's presidency constituted a long period of stability for the college, interrupted by the American Revolution and particularly the Battle of Princeton, during which British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall; American forces, led by George Washington, fired cannon on the building to rout them from it.

In 1812, the eighth president of the College of New Jersey, Ashbel Green (1812–23), helped establish the Princeton Theological Seminary next door.[21] The plan to extend the theological curriculum met with ""enthusiastic approval on the part of the authorities at the College of New Jersey"".[22] Today, Princeton University and Princeton Theological Seminary maintain separate institutions with ties that include services such as cross-registration and mutual library access.[23][24]

Before the construction of Stanhope Hall in 1803, Nassau Hall was the college's sole building. The cornerstone of the building was laid on September 17, 1754.[25] During the summer of 1783, the Continental Congress met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months.[26] Over the centuries and through two redesigns following major fires (1802 and 1855), Nassau Hall's role shifted from an all-purpose building, comprising office, dormitory, library, and classroom space; to classroom space exclusively; to its present role as the administrative center of the University. The class of 1879 donated twin lion sculptures that flanked the entrance until 1911, when that same class replaced them with tigers.[27] Nassau Hall's bell rang after the hall's construction; however, the fire of 1802 melted it. The bell was then recast and melted again in the fire of 1855.[27]

James McCosh became the college's president in 1868 and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the American Civil War.[28] During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic style to the campus.[28] McCosh Hall is named in his honor.[27]

In 1896, the college officially changed its name from the College of New Jersey to Princeton University to honor the town in which it resides.[29] During this year, the college also underwent large expansion and officially became a university. In 1900, the Graduate School was established.[30]"
Princeton Town Wikipedia,"Princeton is a municipality with a borough form of government in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States, that was established in its current form on January 1, 2013, through the consolidation of the Borough of Princeton and Princeton Township. As of the 2010 United States Census, the municipality's population was 28,572, reflecting the former township's population of 16,265, along with the 12,307 in the former borough.[7][8][9][10][11]

Princeton was founded before the American Revolution. It is the home of Princeton University, which bears its name and moved to the community in 1756 from its previous location in Newark. Although its association with the university is primarily what makes Princeton a college town, other important institutions in the area include the Institute for Advanced Study, Westminster Choir College, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton Theological Seminary, Opinion Research Corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Siemens Corporate Research, SRI International, FMC Corporation, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Amrep, Church and Dwight, Berlitz International, and Dow Jones & Company.

Princeton is roughly equidistant from New York City and Philadelphia. It is close to many major highways that serve both cities (e.g. Interstate 95 and US Route 1), and receives major television and radio broadcasts from each. It is also close to Trenton, New Jersey's capital city, and Edison.

The New Jersey governor's official residence has been in Princeton since 1945, when Morven in what was then Princeton Borough became the first Governor's mansion. It was later replaced by the larger Drumthwacket, a colonial mansion located in the former Township. Morven became a museum property of the New Jersey Historical Society.

Princeton was ranked 15th of the top 100 towns in the United States to Live and Work In by Money magazine in 2005.[16] Throughout much of its history, the community was composed of two separate municipalities: a township and a borough. The central borough was completely surrounded by the township. The borough seceded from the township in 1894 in a dispute over school taxes; the two municipalities later formed the Princeton Public Schools, and some other public services were conducted together before they were reunited into a single Princeton in January 2013. Princeton Borough contained Nassau Street, the main commercial street, most of the University campus, and incorporated most of the urban area until the postwar suburbanization. The borough and township had roughly equal populations.

Princeton is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The Borough form of government used by Princeton, the most common system used in the state, is a ""weak mayor / strong council"" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.[33][34][35]

The Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office, serves as the borough's chief executive officer and nominates appointees to various boards and commissions subject to approval of the Borough Council. The Mayor presides at the Borough Council meetings and votes in the case of a tie or a few other specific cases.[35] The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The Council has administrative powers and is the policy-making body of the Borough. The Council approves appointments made by the Mayor. Council Members serve on various boards and committees and act as liaisons to certain Departments, Committees or Boards.[35]

As of 2016, the Mayor of Princeton is Democrat Liz Lempert, whose term of office ends December 31, 2020.[3] Members of the Princeton Borough Council are Council President Bernard P. ""Bernie"" Miller (D, 2017), Jo Butler (D, 2017), Jenny Crumiller (D, 2016), Heather H. Howard (D, 2018), Arden ""Lance"" Liverman (D, 2018) and Patrick Simon (D, 2016).[36][37][38][39][40][41][42]

In 2018, the borough had an average property tax bill of $19,388, the highest in the county, compared to an average bill of $8,767 statewide.[43]

Merger of borough and township[edit]
On November 8, 2011, the residents of both the Borough of Princeton and the Township of Princeton voted to merge the two municipalities into one. In Princeton Borough 1,385 voted for and 902 voted against, while in Princeton Township 3,542 voted for and 604 voted against. Proponents of the merger asserted that when the merger is completed the new municipality of Princeton will save $3.2 million as a result of some scaled down services including layoffs of 15 government workers including 9 police officers (however the measure itself does not mandate such layoffs). Opponents of the measure challenged the findings of a report citing a cost savings as unsubstantiated, and noted that voter representation would be reduced in a smaller government structure.[44] The consolidation took effect on January 1, 2013.[45]

Federal, state and county representation[edit]
Princeton is located in the 12th Congressional District[46] and is part of New Jersey's 16th state legislative district.[8][47][48] Prior to the 2011 reapportionment following the 2010 Census, the former Princeton Borough and Princeton Township had both been in the 15th state legislative district.[49]

For the 116th United States Congress, New Jersey's Twelfth Congressional District is represented by Bonnie Watson Coleman (D, Ewing Township).[50][51] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2021)[52] and Bob Menendez (Paramus, term ends 2025).[53][54]

For the 2018–2019 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 16th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by Christopher Bateman (R, Branchburg) and in the General Assembly by Andrew Zwicker (D, South Brunswick) and Roy Freiman (D, Hillsborough Township).[55][56]

Mercer County is governed by a County Executive who oversees the day-to-day operations of the county and by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders that acts in a legislative capacity, setting policy. All officials are chosen at-large in partisan elections, with the executive serving a four-year term of office while the freeholders serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats up for election each year.[57] As of 2014, the County Executive is Brian M. Hughes (D, term ends December 31, 2015; Princeton).[58] Mercer County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chair Andrew Koontz (D, 2016; Princeton),[59] Freeholder Vice Chair Samuel T. Frisby, Sr. (2015; Trenton),[60] Ann M. Cannon (2015; East Windsor Township),[61] Anthony P. Carabelli (2016; Trenton),[62] John A. Cimino (2014, Hamilton Township),[63] Pasquale ""Pat"" Colavita, Jr. (2015; Lawrence Township)[64] and Lucylle R. S. Walter (2014; Ewing Township)[65][66][67] Mercer County's constitutional officers are County Clerk Paula Sollami-Covello (D, 2015),[68] Sheriff John A. Kemler (D, 2014)[69] and Surrogate Diane Gerofsky (D, 2016).[70][71]

Politics[edit]
As of March 23, 2011, there were a total of 18,049 registered voters in Princeton (a sum of the former Borough and Township's voters), of which 9,184 (50.9%) were registered as Democrats, 2,140 (11.9%) were registered as Republicans and 6,703 (37.1%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There were 22 voters registered to other parties.[72]


Schools in the district (with 2014-15 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics[88]) are Community Park Elementary School[89] (grades K-5; 324 students), Johnson Park Elementary School[90] (PreK-5; 355), Littlebrook Elementary School[91] (K-5; 352), Riverside Elementary School[92] (PreK-5; 286), John Witherspoon Middle School[93] with 708 students in grades 6-8 and Princeton High School[94] with 1,519 students in grades 9-12.[95] The high school is located within the former borough; the other schools are within the former Township boundaries. The high school also serves students from Cranbury Township as part of a sending/receiving relationship.[96]

In the early 1990s, redistricting occurred between the Community Park and Johnson Park School districts, as the population within both districts had increased due to residential development. Concerns were also raised about the largely white, wealthy student population attending Johnson Park (JP) and the more racially and economically diverse population at Community Park (CP). As a result of the redistricting, portions of the affluent Western Section neighborhood were redistricted to CP, and portions of the racially and economically diverse John Witherspoon neighborhood were redistricted to JP.

The Princeton Charter School (grades K-8) operates under a charter granted by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education. The school is a public school that operates independently of the Princeton Regional Schools, and is funded on a per student basis by locally raised tax revenues.[97]

New Jersey Monthly magazine ranked Princeton High School as the 59th-best high school in New Jersey in its 2012 rankings of the ""Top Public High Schools"" in New Jersey, after being ranked 44th in 2010.[98] The school was also ranked as the 10th best school in New Jersey by U.S. News & World Report. [99]

Private schools

Private schools located in Princeton include The Lewis School of Princeton, Princeton Day School, Princeton Friends School, Hun School of Princeton, and Princeton International School of Mathematics and Science (PRISMS).

St. Paul's Catholic School (pre-school to 8th grade) founded in 1878, is the oldest and only coeducational Catholic school, joining Princeton Academy of the Sacred Heart (K-8, all male) and Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart (coed for Pre-K, and all-female K-12), which operate under the supervision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton.[100]

Schools that are outside the town proper but have Princeton addresses include the Wilberforce School, the Laurel School of Princeton, the French-American School of Princeton, YingHua International School, the now defunct American Boychoir School in Plainsboro Township, Chapin School, Princeton Junior School in Lawrence Township, the Waldorf School of Princeton (New Jersey's only Waldorf school), Princeton Montessori School in Montgomery Township, Eden Institute in West Windsor Township, and Princeton Latin Academy in Hopewell.

Public libraries

The Princeton Public Library's current facility on Witherspoon Street was opened in April 2004 as part of the ongoing downtown redevelopment project, and replaced a building dating from 1966. The library itself was founded in 1909.[101]

Miscellaneous education

The Princeton Community Japanese Language School teaches weekend Japanese classes for Japanese citizen children abroad to the standard of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and it also has classes for people with Japanese as a second language. The main office of the school is in Princeton although the office used on Sundays is in Memorial Hall at Rider University in Lawrence Township in Mercer County.[102] Courses are taught at Memorial Hall at Rider University.[103]

Transportation

Roads and highways

As of May 2010, the borough had a total of 126.95 miles (204.31 km) of roadways, of which 118.36 miles (190.48 km) were maintained by the municipality, 3.93 miles (6.32 km) by Mercer County, and 8.66 miles (13.94 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.[104]

U.S. Route 206[105] and New Jersey Route 27[106] pass through Princeton, along with County Routes 583,[107] 571 (commonly known as Washington Road)[108] and 533.[109]

Other major roads that are accessible outside the municipality include U.S. Route 1 (in Lawrence, West Windsor & South Brunswick), Interstate 295 (in Lawrence), and the New Jersey Turnpike/Interstate 95 (in South Brunswick). The closest Turnpike exits are Exit 8A in Monroe Township, Exit 8 in East Windsor, and Exit 7A in Robbinsville.

A number of proposed highways around Princeton have been canceled. The Somerset Freeway (Interstate 95) was to pass just outside the municipality before ending in Hopewell (to the south) and Franklin (to the north). This project was canceled in 1980. Route 92 was supposed to remedy the lack of limited-access highways to the greater Princeton area. The road would have started at Route 1 near Ridge Road in South Brunswick and ended at Exit 8A of the Turnpike. However, that project was cancelled in 2006.


NJ Transit provides bus service to Trenton on the 606 route and local service on route 605.[115] Coach USA Suburban Transit operates frequent daily service to midtown NYC on the 100 route, and weekday rush-hour service to downtown NYC on the 600 route.[116] Princeton and Princeton University provide the FreeB and Tiger Transit local bus services.[117]

Air

Princeton Airport is a public airport lying 3 miles (5 km) north of Downtown Princeton in Montgomery Township. The private Forrestal Airport was located on Princeton University property, 2 miles (3 km) east of the main campus, from the early 1950s through the early 1990s.

The closest commercial airport is Trenton-Mercer Airport in Ewing Township, about 15 miles (24 km) from the center of Princeton, which is served by Frontier Airlines nonstop to and from 17 cities. Other nearby major airports are Newark Liberty International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport, located 39 miles (63 km) and 52 miles (84 km) away, respectively."
Two million-year-old ice cores provide first direct observations of an ancient climate,"Princeton University-led researchers have extracted 2 million-year-old ice cores from Antarctica that provide the first direct observations of Earth’s climate at a time when the furred early ancestors of modern humans still roamed.

Gas bubbles trapped in the cores — which are the oldest yet recovered — contain pristine samples of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases that serve as “snapshots” of prehistoric atmospheric conditions and temperatures, the researchers recently reported in the journal Nature. The cores were collected in the remote Allan Hills of Antarctica.

First author Yuzhen Yan, who received his Ph.D. in geosciences from Princeton in 2019, explained that because ice flows and compresses over time, continual ice cores only extend back to 800,000 years ago. The cores he and his co-authors retrieved are like scenes collected from a very long movie that do not show the whole film, but convey the overall plot.

“You don’t get a sense of how things changed continually, but you get an idea of big changes over time,” said Yan, whose graduate research on ice cores supported by a 2016 Walbridge Fund Graduate Award for Environmental Research from the Princeton Environmental Institute (PEI) was a basis for the current work.

The ice cores reported in Nature are the latest to come out of the research group of senior author John Higgins, a Princeton associate professor of geosciences, PEI associated faculty and Yan’s doctoral co-adviser. A previous team led by Higgins recovered a 1 million-year-old ice core from the Allan Hills, which was the oldest ice core ever recorded by scientists when it was reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2015. The cores were dated by measuring isotopes of the gas argon trapped in bubbles in the ice, a technique developed by co-author Michael Bender, Princeton professor of geosciences, emeritus, and PEI associated faculty.

“The ability to measure atmospheric composition directly is one of the biggest advantages of ice cores,” Yan said. “That’s why people spend years and years in the most isolated places getting them.”

In the latest publication, the researchers use data from the ice cores to answer long-held questions about how our current glacial cycle emerged. Up until roughly 1.2 million years ago, Earth’s ice ages consisted of thinner, smaller glaciers that came and went every 40,000 years on average.

Then, after what is known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, there emerged our current world characterized by colder and longer glacial cycles of 100,000 years. The two periods are known as the 40k and 100k world, respectively.

The researchers collected the 2 million-year-old ice cores in the remote Allan Hills, where high winds help create the environmental conditions that draw ancient ice towards the surface. They found that although a long-term decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide did not directly lead to today’s colder glacial cycle, temperature and global ice volume nonetheless tracked carbon dioxide closely.

Some existing theories have stated that the 100k world — which includes the last ice age that ended 11,700 years ago — came about because of a long-term decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide, Yan said. But the researchers found that this was not the case — average carbon dioxide was relatively steady through the 40k and 100k worlds. While the lowest temperatures and carbon dioxide levels of the 40k world were greater than the low points of the 100k world, the highest levels of both ages were similar.

“It could be the case that after the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, something occurred that lowered global glacial temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide values,” Yan said. “This is the first time we have direct access to these greenhouse gas measurements. The ice core also opens up an array of new measurement possibilities that can give us insights into the 40k world when glacial cycles were very different from what we have today.”

Although a long-term decline in average atmospheric carbon dioxide may not have directly led to the 100k world, the researchers nonetheless observed a correlation between carbon dioxide and global temperature, Bender said.

“To say that carbon dioxide is not a factor would be completely wrong,” Bender said. “During the 40,000- and 100,0000-year glacial-interglacial cycles, temperature and global ice volume tracks carbon dioxide rather closely. Carbon dioxide changes are required to get from the cooler glacial temperatures to the warmer interglacial temperatures.”

The amount of carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere tops 400 parts-per-million (ppm), which is nearly 100 ppm higher than the highest levels of the 40k world, Yan said.

“We’re seeing carbon dioxide levels not seen in 2 million years,” Yan said. “While our data suggest that long-term carbon dioxide decline was not the decisive factor in the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, it does not mean that carbon dioxide does not have the capability to bring about global-scale changes.

“We’re in a different situation now — carbon dioxide is the major player in our current world,” he said. “If we want to look into the geologic past for an analogy of what’s going on in our world today, we need to go beyond 2 million years to find it.”

Yan, Higgins and Bender worked on the study in Nature with Preston Cosslett Kemeny, a Hertz Foundation Fellow at the California Institute of Technology who received his bachelor’s degree in geosciences and certificates in environmental studies and planets and life from Princeton in 2015. Co-authors also included Edward Brook at Oregon State University; Heather Clifford, Paul Mayewski and Andrei Kurbatov at the University of Maine; Sean Mackay, a past postdoctoral researcher at Princeton now at Boston University; and Jessica Ng and Jeffrey Severinghaus at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography."
"U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on Princeton, Microsoft challenge to DACA termination","The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Tuesday on cases challenging the federal government’s termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, including a complaint filed by Princeton University, Microsoft and Princeton graduate María Perales Sánchez.

The November 2017 complaint — one of the first challenges to the government’s decision to end DACA — alleged that program’s termination violated both the United States Constitution and federal law. Since then, several district courts and courts of appeal have ruled that the government’s decision to rescind DACA was unlawful.

Perales Sánchez, Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber and Microsoft President and Princeton University Trustee Brad Smith attended the hearing on Tuesday at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C.

Speaking alongside Perales Sánchez and Smith outside the court following the hearing, Eisgruber said the justices heard arguments that focused on “the importance of the government speaking plainly and honestly and in a straight-forward way so that people could hold it accountable for the decisions that it makes, particularly when it affects thousands of people like María.”

“But the issues that bring us here today … go deeper than that,” Eisgruber said. “They are issues about the human consequences of this program and what it means for María and other DACA beneficiaries, and they are about the basic principles that this country has stood for over time — principles that encourage honest, hard-working people to make their homes here and that have made this country a beacon for freedom throughout its history.”

Play Video: Supreme Court hears DACA cases
Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber, 2018 alumna María Perales Sánchez, and Microsoft President and 1981 alumnus Brad Smith attended the hearing Nov. 12 at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C.

In a Time Ideas column this week, Eisgruber and Smith explained why their institutions are fighting for DACA, writing:

“Talent, from every source and background, is the lifeblood of innovation. As the presidents of Microsoft and Princeton University, we have seen firsthand how participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program contribute to our institutions and our country. Standing up for DACA students is not only the right thing to do morally, it is also the right thing to do competitively.”

In this video, Perales Sánchez, who graduated from Princeton in 2018, speaks about what it would mean to have a permanent solution for DACA recipients, who are also known as Dreamers.

“[A permanent resolution] would mean having control over my life, which I think is a basic human right to be able to have some kind of control over your life,” said Perales Sánchez, who also spoke about the case in an article by the Baltimore Sun.

The DACA program permits undocumented students who arrived in the country as children to obtain protection from deportation, allowing them to continue their studies or work in the United States.

Princeton has been a leading voice among higher education regarding immigration issues. President Christopher L. Eisgruber joined hundreds of colleges and universities in issuing a statement supporting DACA in 2016, and he advocated for the continuation of the DACA program in an August 2017 letter to President Donald Trump. Eisgruber also urged members of Congress to pass legislation that would provide legal status for immigrants living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status.  

This spring, Eisgruber and higher education leaders across New Jersey sent a letter to the state’s Congressional delegation about the obstacles their institutions face in attracting and retaining international faculty, students and staff. Princeton also expressed concern for international students who continue to be impacted by governmental delays in approving Optional Practical Training (OPT) for employment and internships in the United States."
Pioneering NASA engineer Darden shares her journey from ‘human computer’ to expert in supersonic flight,"In the late 1960s, Christine Darden was one of many women working as “human computers” at NASA’s Langley Research Center. Male engineers assigned her team to perform calculations that enabled the Apollo spaceflight missions to take humans to the moon and return them safely to Earth.

She soon realized that the equations were similar to the ones she had worked with as a graduate student in mathematics. Darden asked a director at NASA why men and women with the same qualifications were placed in such different jobs — men in engineering sections and women in computing pools.

“He looked at me and he said, ‘Nobody ever asked that question before,’” Darden said. “I said, ‘Well, I’m asking it now.’”

A few weeks later, she was transferred to an aerospace engineering team.

In this 1976 photo, Darden holds one of the models tested in her research on sonic boom minimization. “We wanted to find out how [the sonic boom] was generated, how we could predict it, and how we could reduce it so that maybe supersonic flight over land would be possible,” she said.

On Nov. 15, the School of Engineering and Applied Science marked this year’s 50th anniversary of the first moon landings with a visit from Darden, who shared highlights from her 40-year career at NASA during a lunch talk at the Fields Center with graduate students and community members. Her visit was sponsored by the engineering school’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.

Darden, who became the first African American appointed to the highest rank at Langley Research Center, is one of four women featured in the 2016 book “Hidden Figures,” which chronicles the lives of African American women at NASA from the 1930s to the 1960s. All four women were honored earlier this month with Congressional Gold Medals — the United States’ highest civilian award.

Addressing aspiring engineers in the audience, Darden shared guidance for overcoming challenges to achieve “your dream career” — a set of principles she calls P4: perceive of yourself in the career; plan; prepare; and persist. Students asked her about how she balanced her career with her family life, and how it felt to be working at NASA amid the uncertainty of the first Apollo moon missions.

Darden landed at NASA Langley in 1967, after working as a math teacher and a research assistant and earning a master’s degree at Virginia State College. She later earned a Ph.D. in engineering, and went on to lead Langley’s Sonic Boom Team, developing strategies to mitigate the effects of potential supersonic air transport.

Darden outlined some of the approaches used by her team, including testing potential aircraft designs with computational techniques and with physical models in supersonic wind tunnels. “We wanted to find out how [the sonic boom] was generated, how we could predict it, and how we could reduce it so that maybe supersonic flight over land would be possible.”

Over the years, the program was suspended and later resurrected. Recently, Darden told the group, Lockheed Martin Corp. partnered with NASA on a new project for supersonic aircraft, with initial flight tests set to take place in 2021.

“They’re going to fly it over people just like you all over this country and get your feedback on how the noise from that plane sounds. They say it’s just a rumble and people will adjust to it,” Darden said. Because of her team’s foundational work, she added, someday soon we may be able “to get on a plane and fly to Los Angeles in a couple of hours.”"
Princeton Football Wikipedia,"First football game

Main article: 1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game
Students from The College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) traveled to New Brunswick, New Jersey on November 6, 1869 to play Rutgers College (now Rutgers University) in a game using a modified version of London's Football Association rules. The game included 25 players on each side and the round ball could only be advanced by kicking it.[2] Rutgers won what has been called the first intercollegiate American football game 6 goals to 4. A week later, the Rutgers team traveled to Princeton for a rematch, which Princeton won 8–0.

Early history

Due in part to their invention of the sport, the Tigers were one of the dominant forces in the early days of intercollegiate football, winning 22 of the first 40 national titles (between 1869 and 1909). As the sport transformed at the hands of figures like Penn's John Heisman and Yale’s Walter Camp and more schools began competing, Princeton and the rest of the eventual Ivy League faded out of national championship contention. The Tigers won their last national championship in 1950 when Dick Kazmaier, the 1951 Heisman Trophy winner, was a junior.[3]

Formation of the Ivy League

When Princeton joined Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, and Yale Universities, Dartmouth College, and the University of Pennsylvania in formally organizing the Ivy League athletic conference in 1955, conference rules prohibited post-season play in football. (Princeton never competed in the post-season.) The policy further insulated Princeton and the Ivy League from the national spotlight. Despite an undefeated season in 1964, Princeton was not among the top 10 teams in the season-ending Associated Press poll.[4]

NCAA Division I subdivision split

The NCAA split Division I collegiate football into two subdivisions in 1978, then called I-A for larger schools, and I-AA for the smaller ones. The NCAA had devised the split, in part, with the Ivy League in mind, but the conference did not move down for 4 seasons. Unable to play competitively against long-time rival Rutgers anymore, Princeton stopped scheduling them as a football opponent after 1980. Then in 1982 the NCAA created a rule that stated a program’s average attendance must be at least 15,000 to qualify for I-A membership. This forced the conference’s hand, as only some of the member schools met the attendance qualification. Choosing to stay together rather than stand their ground separately in the increasingly competitive I-A subdivision, the Ivy League moved down into I-AA starting with the 1982 season.[5] Despite often finishing its seasons ranked in the championship subdivision, Princeton cannot play in the NCAA Division I Football Championship per Ivy League rules.

Recent history

Since the formation of the Ivy League, Princeton has achieved moderate success on the gridiron, with eleven Ivy League championships, three outright and eight shared, 10 Big Three championships since 1955. In 2009, Princeton hired Bob Surace.[6] Surace was an All-Ivy league center at Princeton and graduated in 1990.

Championships

National championships

Princeton has won 28 national championships from NCAA-designated major selectors.[7][8]:110–112 Although they do not compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, they maintain claims to titles won at the highest level at the time, with retroactive championships for the 19th century, in which Princeton was declared champion for twenty different seasons in a thirty year span from 1869 to 1899. All except the last title were won in the era prior to the Associated Press poll selecting champions starting in 1936, with the final national championship claim coming from a different poll than the Associated Press. On some occasions, Princeton shared a championships with other teams, with as many as four other teams claiming a championship for certain years, such as 1922, when five teams were given a title in some form with only one tie separating the five unbeaten teams including Princeton. Princeton claims all 28 titles.[9]

Stadium and facilities

Palmer Stadium

In 1914, Princeton built Palmer Stadium, the third college football stadium ever built and what was the second oldest standing college stadium until its demolition in 1996. Palmer Stadium was modeled after the Greek Olympic stadium and seated 45,750 spectators. In the 1990s the university decided to demolish it for a new stadium rather than undertake a long and expensive renovation process, as Harvard had with its stadium in 1984.

Princeton University Stadium

During the construction of the new stadium, the Tigers played a season of nine away games, plus a homecoming game against Yale at Giants Stadium in 1997. Princeton University Stadium opened on September 19, 1998 and seats 27,773. After eight years of natural grass fields, FieldTurf artificial playing surface was installed for the 2006 football season and the field was named ""Powers Field"" in honor of William C. Powers, Princeton class of 1979, who was an All-Ivy punter for the Tigers and donated $10 million to the football program that year.

Practice facilities

The Finney-Campbell practice fields to the east of Princeton University Stadium have been outfitted with FieldTurf. They consist of nearly 1,600 square feet (150 m2) of playing surface, with two full football fields and lines for men’s and women’s lacrosse."
Business Today Snippet,"Founded by Steve Forbes in 1968, Business Today has spent nearly 50 years creating a dynamic forum for top undergraduate students to connect with today’s most influential and inspirational business leaders. Originally called the Foundation for Student Communication, BT was originally comprised solely of the printed magazine, with articles written by undergraduates and business leaders. Today, we have expanded our programming but continued our mission: to enable and empower open lines of communication between business leaders and the students who will eventually follow in their footsteps. Through our conferences, multimedia content, seminars, and assorted programming, Business Today gives students and leaders alike a chance to expand their horizons and broaden their view of the business world. 

Gusiness Today (Grace Hong): Let’s start off with your background. You attended undergrad in Texas, you studied law at Harvard, and now you’re the founder and CEO of Capital Innovators, which is based in St. Louis. You’ve also been CEO of several other companies in between. Can you talk a little about how you got to where you are today?

Judy Sindecuse: I went to SMU for my undergraduate studies and majored in engineering with a minor in math. Following undergrad, I proceeded to law school where I actually thought I would become a prosecutor. My plan after graduation was to work at a large firm, gain several years of experience, pay off my student loans, and then work at a U.S. Attorney’s office. During my first year as an attorney, I came up with an idea for a business—as an aside, I actually started my first business in college, and I sold it to go to law school. I realized that there was no way I could practice law and run a business at the same time. I was pretty excited about the idea, so I left the practice of law to go start the business. In the course of running that business, I had a problem that needed solving to make that business successful, and in solving that problem, I realized that the solution could become its own business. The same thing happened several more times where I ended up creating a new business to solve a problem with the current business I was running. All in all, I ended up creating six businesses before I moved to St. Louis, which is my hometown, to raise my kids.

While I was working on my next business idea, I began volunteering at a non-profit that helped launch early stage IT companies. I had already been doing some of my own investing in IT companies, and through the course of volunteering, I realized there were quite a few companies in the program that had smart, passionate founders sitting on really great ideas. However, they weren’t getting the funding or mentorship they needed in order to get to the next level—or at least, not enough to encourage a stranger to invest in their business. I told the CEO of the non-profit that I had an idea on how to alleviate this problem: they should gather a bunch of high net-worth individuals who had already built their own businesses to not just invest money in a small fund, but also mentor these companies using their expertise. I planned to structure the mentorship more efficiently than what I had seen happening in other non-profits that sought to accomplish the same thing. The CEO of the non-profit thought it was a great idea, but when I tried to do it under the non-profit umbrella, investors said that they didn’t want to do it because they wanted to have the capacity to earn a return. I went back to the CEO with this information and she encouraged me to do the idea privately, and that is how Capital Innovators was born.

This was back in 2010 when the moniker “accelerator” was just being formed. Nobody had used that terminology before. In fact, these programs didn’t exist at the time. It wasn’t until a year after I started the company that I was introduced to one of the founders of TechStars—which coined the phrase “accelerator program” —that I realized I had created an “accelerator”. Importantly, my model doesn’t look like other accelerators because at the time I started Capital Innovators, there weren’t really any other accelerator models to copy. I was really just trying to solve a problem that existed in my own city.

Since then, Capital Innovators has done really well. We’ve consistently been ranked among the top accelerators five years in a row. We’re one of the only accelerators with a top ranking without a location on the coast and one of the few female-led accelerators with a top ranking. I manage three different investment funds that have invested in over 120 companies. 85% of our companies are still in business, and my top ten companies have averaged a 1700% growth rate. As a result of our success, a number of other programs built on our momentum in St. Louis. Now we have so much going on in St. Louis that a major publication has named us the second best city in which to start a business. In the beginning, I really wasn’t setting out to turn St. Louis into a startup hub, but I’m really excited that’s what happened. Now, I’m intentionally working on that goal. Capital Innovators has a name that’s internationally recognized, and we receive over a thousand applications each year that come from 70+ countries and 48 U.S. states, and I’ve spoken at conferences around the world, including in South Korea, Russia, and Sicily. It’s been really exciting.

BT: As someone from Chicago, I’ve personally felt that the Midwest’s tech ecosystem is behind those of the coasts. Having started an accelerator in the Midwest, what do you feel has been the major challenges to growing tech startups? What are the most promising opportunities, and how can we continue to grow those?

JS: One of the reasons why St. Louis has been so great is that it doesn’t have a lot else going on. The whole city has been behind its growth in entrepreneurship and really supports the cause. Chicago has a lot of business activity going on and startups don’t quite receive similar support. In addition, St. Louis is a big city that feels like a small town, and if you’re a startup here, you’ll receive so much attention and support. It’s also a fifth of the cost to start a business in St. Louis as compared to the coasts, and one of the greatest risks that a company faces at its start is undercapitalization. If your money can go five times further, not only does that help the company save on business expenses, which reduces their risk, but it also means the company does not have to raise as much money, which helps reduce dilution for investors. As a result, as an investor in a company growing in St. Louis, my funds will maintain a higher ownership in the company, and when the company reaches an exit, the fund will generate a far greater return.

One challenge I see is that young talent like college graduates oftentimes think that things are more exciting on the coasts than the Midwest. Tech talent that is fresh out of college might be hard to come by. The good news is, if you’re a bit older and raising a family, you’ll realize that you may want to raise your family in the Midwest—it’s a different lifestyle. Having said that, the more startup activity we have in St. Louis, the more exciting it feels to college graduates. We are finding more and more are choosing to stay at home or stay close to schools in the Midwest. We have a lot of great universities, including Washington University, St. Louis University, Webster, Fontbonne, Lindenwood, and UMSL, which is more than other cities our size.

BT: In recent weeks, we’ve seen the disintegration of WeWork, and there’s this whole phenomenon of “counterfeit capitalism,” in which investors are pouring money into one major player, like Amazon, who will eventually take over the industry and be able to serve at extremely low costs. Over the last couple years, have developments like these influenced your investment criteria? What makes a startup stand out today versus five or ten years ago?

JS: What you’re bringing up seems like an important point. I do sometimes joke that the novel 1984, where there was always a war going on between three major superpowers, is actually happening, but instead of three major powers, it’s companies: Google, Amazon, and Alibaba. I do find that personally concerning. With regards to the startup world, major players like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have so much cash on their books and they really need to start spending it. Oftentimes, that might mean buying out smaller companies. However, there are also roll-ups—where a smallish company buys another smallish company—or a smallish company buys an even smaller company to improve their bottom line, and these transactions can make these companies competitive against the giants. You can still have a good investment strategy where you’re hoping to exit through acquisition, without necessarily promoting these giants; rather, on the opposite end, it will provide better competition for them.

 

BT: You’ve previously mentioned Capitol Innovators’ unique mentorship network. Can you talk about how you built up this network, and how Capital Innovators’ mentorship model differs from other accelerators?

JS: The network isn’t necessarily unique; what’s unique is the process that we use. I built the network mainly through word-of-mouth in the beginning; I shared it with a mentor, who spoke to their friend, who spoke to a friend of a friend, and so on. Now that I have a well-known brand, I have people that reach out to me and ask about mentorship in my program. Whenever I speak, whether it’s around the world or at home, I always say there are all kinds of opportunities to get involved, whether it’s as an investor, mentor, or even a service provider that can help startups save money. It’s a way for me to find more people who are ready to give back to this ecosystem. It allows people to help others and help their community, but they also get a lot out of it directly. My mentors have said to me that this is the best education that they’ve ever had in their life. Here are people who have been there and done that, but they’re still learning. They enjoy having responsibility without a full-time job. They enjoy the camaraderie of other like-minded individuals. Our mentors are A-type personalities who don’t want to spend their entire lives on a golf course as they want to stay relevant and on the cutting edge of what’s going on in the technology world. It provides a great win-win scenario for our mentors and founders.

In terms of how our network is unique, we are very hands-on. We build a whole C-suite for each of our companies, meaning someone that acts as the co-CEO for the thirteen week program, and others act as every other C-suite level (e.g. COO, CTO, etc.). Those veterans spend anywhere from twelve to twenty hours each week helping companies. They don’t just give advice; they roll up their sleeves, dig in, and help do the work to show the companies. They lead by example by showing our startups how they should be running their business. The idea behind this is that we’re teaching the entrepreneur. I actually like the analogy of teaching someone to ride a bike. At the end of the thirteen weeks, we hope that you can ride on your own, but if you ever fall off, we will be there to pick you up, dust you off, and put you back on your way. It’s a very intensive hands-on approach. Also, we coordinate all of our mentors, so we work towards the same goal, instead of risking “mentor whiplash,” where one mentor may recommend one thing and another may recommend something else. We make sure we’re always on the same team and establishing and supporting the same goals for companies.

 

BT: Do you have any advice you’d like to share with undergraduates?

JS: I know that oftentimes when you want to be an entrepreneur, you set out to find some idea that you can turn into a business. That’s okay, but you’ll have a much better shot at coming up with a really good idea if you go out in the world and start experiencing it. When you run into a problem that’s driving you crazy and you have to create a solution for yourself, and then you figure out how to market that solution to other people, that’s a better way of coming up with an idea for a business. Those are the ideas that will work. It’s a lot easier to sell pain relief to customers, where it’s a solution to an actual problem, rather than an opportunity to make something better.

The other suggestion is that everybody seems to want to be the chief, the founder, or CEO. I think there are so many really great startups that are struggling to build quality teams. It’s great to be an early member on another startup team. Imagine if you were the number five person at Google; you don’t have to be number one to be a huge success from a money standpoint and even an autonomy standpoint. If you are number three or number four at a startup, no one’s monitoring your day-to-day activity. You’ll have a responsibility in that startup. You’ll have to come up with how to take care of it, and you’ll feel like a founder. If you don’t have your own killer idea, don’t just come up with something just to have something. Go work for another startup. That’s really a great way to satisfy that entrepreneurial spirit and make a lot of money while you’re doing it.

Statistics show: Vocal music really is universal,"Nearly 200 years ago, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow claimed that “Music is the universal language of mankind.” Over the past several years, an international team of researchers has explored music from around the world to determine whether that is true or merely cliché — and a Princetonian crunched the numbers.

“Our article finds universal patterns in vocal music — both the social contexts in which it occurs and the auditory structure of the song,” said Dean Knox, a computational social scientist and assistant professor of politics at Princeton. “These patterns are similar across hundreds of small-scale societies. Among other results, we show that machine-learning techniques can reliably recognize the social function of a song — i.e. dance songs, healing songs, love songs, lullabies — even without knowing anything about the culture or region that created the song, based only on patterns learned from other societies.” Their paper appears today in the journal Science.

The research team included psychologists, anthropologists, biologists, musicians, linguists and other experts from 11 institutions on three continents, including Harvard University, Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, the University of Rochester’s Eastman School of Music, the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Germany, McGill University in Canada, as well as two political scientists to manage the extraordinary data set: Knox and his graduate school roommate, Christopher Lucas, now an assistant professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis.

“I guess you wouldn’t imagine political scientists on the team to analyze music – but here that’s one of our bread-and-butter things,” Lucas said. “Everything we do can be analyzed as data. Twenty years ago in political science, you studied polls and votes. Today, we study the way politicians talk, the audio recordings, the way people are affected. … The tools we’ve developed to study that in politics have a lot of punch when applied elsewhere, too.”

The 19-person team set out to answer big questions: Is music a cultural universal? If it is, which musical qualities overlap across disparate societies? If it isn’t, why does it seem so ubiquitous?

To answer these questions, they needed a dataset of unprecedented breadth and depth. Over a five-year period, the team hunted down hundreds of recordings in libraries and private collections of scientists half a world away.

“We are so used to being able to find any piece of music that we like on the internet,” said Samuel Mehr, a principal investigator at Harvard’s Music Lab and the first author on the paper. “But there are thousands and thousands of recordings buried in archives that are not accessible online. We didn’t know what we would find: at one point we found an odd-looking call number, asked a Harvard librarian for help, and 20 minutes later she wheeled out a cart of about 20 cases of reel-to-reel recordings of traditional Celtic music.”

The research team ultimately examined 315 societies across the planet, for which all but six were found in ethnographic documents listed in the Human Relations Area Files organization. They collected around 5,000 descriptions of song from a subset of 60 cultures spanning 30 distinct geographic regions. For the discography, they collected 118 songs from a total of 86 cultures, again covering 30 geographic regions.

Their deep dive into song helped to create the National History of Song (NHS) Ethnography, for which they coded dozens of variables. The researchers logged details about singers and audience members, time of day, duration of singing, presence of instruments, and more details for thousands of passages about songs in the ethnographic corpus. The discography was analyzed four different ways: machine summaries, listener ratings, expert annotations and expert transcriptions.

“It’s a significant project,” Lucas said. “Exceptionally difficult. The data collection was very big. For the analysis, about 10,000 lines of codes were written. Dean and I were in there, doing the actual statistical analysis of the paper.” Knox and Lucas compiled and crunched data, including nearly 500,000 words gleaned from song descriptions across those 315 societies and codifying those so each society had a median group of nearly 50 songs to examine.

Their big questions led to one big answer: Music pervades social life in similar ways all around the world.

“Scholars have made sweeping claims about the universality of music and music-related behavior, but these claims are incredibly hard to test,” Knox said. “We were working with unstructured audio recordings and textual ethnographic descriptions of song, not the simple numeric data that most analysts are used to. The question is, how can we empirically evaluate these ideas with messy and complex data? For example, every ethnographer has their own biases about what to describe, so we had to think carefully about the right way to use their accounts to draw statistically principled conclusions about patterns in music.”

They found that, across societies, music is associated with behaviors such as infant care (lullabies), healing, dance, love, mourning, warfare, processions, ritual — and that these behaviors are not terribly different from society to society. They discovered that music for those universal behaviors tended to have similar musical features, which Knox and Lucas were able to train a computer to recognize.

“One of our most surprising results is that machines, which have no knowledge of human psychology or music theory, can be trained to recognize lullabies, healing songs, love songs and dance songs — even in cultures that they’ve never seen before,” Knox said.

For Mehr, the study is a first step toward unlocking the governing rules of “musical grammar.” That idea has been percolating among music theorists, linguists and psychologists of music for decades, but had never been demonstrated across cultures.

“In music theory, tonality is often assumed to be an invention of Western music, but our data raise the controversial possibility that this could be a universal feature of music,” Mehr said. “That raises pressing questions about structure that underlies music everywhere — and whether and how our minds are designed to make music.”

For Knox, the most exciting part is that machines are learning to decode emotion and tone. “Chris Lucas and I have been successful in training machines to identify even complex human concepts like skepticism, and to learn how and why humans use them the way they do,” he said. “We’re getting closer and closer to being able to characterize and analyze human communication in its full richness.”

"Foam offers way to manipulate light
","There is more to foam than meets the eye. Literally. A study by Princeton scientists has shown that a type of foam long studied by researchers is able to block particular wavelengths of light, a coveted property for next-generation information technology that uses light instead of electricity.

The researchers, integrating expertise from materials science, chemistry and physics, conducted exhaustive computational simulations of a structure known as a Weaire-Phelan foam. They found that this foam would allow some frequencies of light to pass through while completely reflecting others. This selective blocking, known as a photonic band gap, is similar to the behavior of a semiconductor, the bedrock material behind all modern electronics because of its ability to control the flow of electrons at extremely small scales.

“This has the property we want: an omnidirectional mirror for a certain range of frequencies,” said Salvatore Torquato, professor of chemistry and the Princeton Institute for the Science and Technology of Materials. Torquato, the Lewis Bernard Professor of Natural Sciences, published the results Nov. 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, with co-authors Michael Klatt, a postdoctoral researcher, and physicist Paul Steinhardt, who is Princeton’s Albert Einstein Professor in Science.

While numerous examples of photonic band gaps have been shown previously in various types of crystals, the researchers believe that their new finding is the first example in a foam, similar to the froth of soap bubbles or a draft beer. Unlike the disordered foam of beer however, the Weaire-Phelan foam is a precisely structured arrangement with deep roots in mathematics and physics.

The origins of the Weaire-Phelan foam date to 1887 when the Scottish physicist Lord Kelvin proposed a structure for the “ether,” the mysterious substance that was then thought to comprise a background structure to all space. Although the concept of the ether was already falling out of favor at the time, Kelvin’s proposed foam went on to intrigue mathematicians for a century because it appeared to be the most efficient way to fill space with interlocking geometrical shapes that have the least possible surface area.

In 1993, physicists Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan found an alternative arrangement that requires slightly less surface area. Since then, interest in the Weaire-Phelan structure was mainly in the mathematics, physics and artistic communities. The structure was used as the outer wall of the “Beijing Water Cube” created for the 2008 Olympics. The new finding now makes the structure of interest to materials scientists and technologists.

“You start out with a classical, beautiful problem in geometry, in mathematics, and now suddenly you have this material that opens up a photonic band gap,” Torquato said.

Torquato, Klatt and Steinhardt became interested in the Weaire-Phelan foam as a tangent of another project in which they were investigating “hyperuniform” disordered materials as an innovative way to control light. Although not their original focus, the three realized that this precisely structured foam had intriguing properties.

“Little by little, it became apparent that there was something interesting here,” Torquato said. “And eventually we said, ‘OK, let’s put the main project to the side for a while to pursue this.’”

“Always look out for what’s at the wayside of research,” Klatt added.

Weaire, who was not involved in this new finding, said that the Princeton discovery is part of a broadening interest in the material since he and Phelan discovered it. He said the possible new use in optics likely stems from the material being very isotropic, or not having strongly directional properties.

“The fact that it displays a photonic band gap is very interesting because it turns out to have so many special properties,” said Andrew Kraynik, an expert in foams who earned his Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Princeton in 1977 and has studied the Weaire-Phelan foam extensively but was not involved in the Princeton study. Another Princeton connection, said Kraynik, is that a key tool in discovering and analyzing the Weaire-Phelan foam is a software tool called Surface Evolver, which optimizes shapes according to their surface properties and was written by Ken Brakke, who earned his Ph.D. in mathematics at Princeton in 1975.

To show that the Weaire-Phelan foam exhibited the light-controlling properties they were seeking, Klatt developed a meticulous set of calculations that he executed on the supercomputing facilities of the Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering.

“The programs he had to run are really computationally intensive,” Torquato said.

The work opens numerous possibilities for further invention, said the researchers, who dubbed the new area of work as “phoamtonics” (a mashup of “foam” and “photonics”). Because foams occur naturally and are relatively easy to make, one possible goal would be to coax raw materials to self-organize into the precise arrangement of the Weaire-Phelan foam, Torquato said.

With further development, the foam could transport and manipulate light used in telecommunications. Currently much of the data traversing the internet is carried by glass fibers. However, at its destination, the light is converted back to electricity. Photonic band gap materials could guide the light much more precisely than conventional fiber optic cables and might serve as optical transistors that perform computations using light.

“Who knows?” said Torquato. “Once you have this as a result, then it provides experimental challenges for the future.”"
"Boosting wind farmers, global winds reverse decades of slowing and pick up speed","In a boon to wind farms, average daily wind speeds are picking up across much of the globe after about 30 years of gradual slowing. Research led by a team at Princeton University shows that wind speeds in northern mid-latitude regions have increased by roughly 7% since 2010.

The findings mark a reversal of the pattern of declining winds in these regions since the 1980s — a phenomenon known as global terrestrial stilling. Focusing on regions of North America, Europe and Asia where wind power is on the rise, the researchers analyzed wind speed records collected between 1978 and 2017 from more than 1,400 weather stations. In a paper published Nov. 18 in Nature Climate Change, they showed that while wind speeds decreased by about 2.3% per decade beginning in 1978, since 2010 wind speeds have increased at a rate that is nearly three times faster.

The research, which looked only at regional averages, did not examine how the uptick in wind speeds might affect the severity of storms, which also has been increasing.

The team examined the potential causes underlying global terrestrial stilling and its reversal. While changes in urbanization and vegetation have been proposed as contributors to global terrestrial stilling, these trends have not reversed since 2010, said Zhenzhong Zeng, who led the study as a postdoctoral researcher working with Eric Wood, Princeton’s Susan Dod Brown Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Emeritus.

Zeng and his colleagues used statistical methods to test associations between variations in wind speed and an array of well-characterized ocean-atmosphere oscillations. Ocean-atmosphere oscillations, which alter distributions of heat and pressure, had long been understood to drive ocean wind speeds, and this study demonstrated the global relationship between the oscillations and land-based wind speeds.

The analysis showed that in each region of the globe, specific large-scale ocean-atmosphere oscillations, which are driven by many factors including the uneven heating of the Earth’s surface in different regions, were likely explanations for the observed trends in wind speeds.

Extending their findings to wind power generation, the researchers calculated that a typical wind turbine receiving the global average wind would have produced about 17% more energy in 2017 than in 2010. And using climate indices to project future wind speeds, they predicted a 37% increase by 2024.

Wind speed trends may account for much of the United States’ increase in wind energy production efficiency from 2010 to 2017, whereas technological innovations in wind turbines may have played a smaller role than is often assumed, said Zeng, who is now an associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China.

“We predict that the increasing wind speed trend will continue for 10 years, but we also show that because this is caused by ocean-atmosphere oscillations, maybe a decade later it will reverse again,” he said. And since the lifespan of a wind turbine is usually 20 years at most, having reliable projections of wind speeds at particular locations could be crucial to making smart investments in wind power and increasing the global share of renewable energy.

“Knowing about possible downtrends in wind speeds in the longer term can indeed be very useful for planning of future wind power infrastructure,” said Charles Meneveau, a mechanical engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the study. “This type of research, blending geosciences and engineering to elucidate phenomena of great societal significance, is timely and will increase our understanding of the close connections between climate and society.”

In addition to Wood and Zeng, researchers involved in the project included: Alan Ziegler, of the National University of Singapore; Timothy Searchinger, a research scholar at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs; Long Yang, of Nanjing University; Anping Chen, of Colorado State University; Kunlu Ju, of Tsinghua University; Shilong Piao, of Peking University; Laurent Li, of Sorbonne Université, Philippe Ciais, of France’s Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’Environnement, Deliang Chen and Cesar Azorin-Molina, of the University of Gothenburg; Junguo Liu, of China’s Southern University of Science and Technology; Adrian Chappell, of Cardiff University; and David Medvigy, of the University of Notre Dame. Support for the project was provided in part by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Southern University of Science and Technology, and Lamsam–Thailand Sustain Development."
Schmidt DataX Fund supports research projects that harness data science to speed up discovery,"Nine data-driven research projects have won funding from Princeton University’s Schmidt DataX Fund, which aims to spread and deepen the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning across campus to accelerate discovery.

In February, the University announced the new fund, which was made possible through a major gift from Schmidt Futures.

The newly selected faculty research projects the Schmidt DataX Fund is supporting are cross-disciplinary and involve 19 faculty members and several departments and programs.

Among the research the projects explore are brain activity and language, crowd behavioral issues on social media, and the construction of the Milky Way.

“The variety of projects and the mix of researchers involved shows that data science is of great interest to many disciplines on campus to help accelerate discovery, whether by scaling up experiments or modeling complex processes,” said Peter Ramadge, the Gordon Y.S. Wu Professor of Engineering and professor of electrical engineering and the director of the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML). “The use of advanced data science algorithms and modern computation enables research that was once difficult or impossible to conduct.” CSML is overseeing a range of efforts made possible by the Schmidt DataX Fund to extend the reach of data science across campus.

"Achieving climate goals requires setting a price on carbon, experts say at Andlinger Center meeting","Cutting carbon emissions quickly requires a price on carbon, experts from industry, government and academia said at the annual meeting of the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment last week. A carbon fee would provide a dual benefit: offer direct incentives to cut emissions, and also create a new market for firms that can monetize carbon dioxide as a resource by transforming the gas into products and fuels.

“To curb the effects of climate change, we need to significantly reduce carbon emissions as soon as possible, yet global energy demand is expected to grow by 30% over the next two decades,” said Yueh-Lin (Lynn) Loo, the Andlinger Center director and the Theodora D. ’78 and William H. Walton III ’74 Professor in Engineering. “We must find ways to quickly develop and deploy sustainable technologies.”

A price on carbon would harness the power of the market to create and scale such technologies, the experts said at the center’s eighth annual meeting. A carbon price would generate powerful reasons for entrepreneurs to spark new technology and for industry to move it to a global scale. 

Phil Sharp, a former U.S. representative and chair of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power, in the morning keynote address advocated for a carbon tax, noting that policy is one of the most effective ways to signal to the market the need for emissions reductions and to successfully achieve them.

“That is not to say that this is a sufficient policy for climate but, in my view, and in many others’, it ought to be a central policy,” said Sharp.

David Babson, a program director at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, said that by the year 2100, mitigating climate change will require the annual removal of 20 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, more than the current emissions of the U.S. trucking, oil and gas industries. To do this, society needs to make carbon dioxide removal and utilization profitable.

“The largest industry on the face of this Earth in 2100 is going to be carbon removal and management,” said Babson. “We need to begin to immediately establish and grow a large, robust carbon removal industry … and innovate in a number of areas to address our food, water and resource challenges.”

Babson spoke during a morning presentation on using data science to improve the management of water and energy systems. He was one of 15 experts who spoke at the full-day event on Nov. 8, which convened corporate leaders, researchers, students and policymakers for panel discussions and two keynote speeches. The day featured presentations on a range of topics, including on creating new environmentally friendly fuels to sustainably power industries, and transforming atmospheric carbon into useful products. Participants explored ways to bring disparate fields together to move toward the goal of drastically reducing atmospheric carbon.

In the afternoon keynote address, David Eaglesham, an entrepreneur who has been involved in several startups in the energy and technology sectors, said incentives have been critical to the introduction of  renewables into the electric grid. But making similar strides to decarbonize the remaining sectors of industry, such as steel and cement production and transportation, will be more difficult. He noted that making those strides will require additional strategies, including using cheap renewable electricity, as opposed to curtailing it when supply exceeds energy demand. Cheap renewable electricity will be crucial to sustainably producing hydrogen fuel. He said a carbon price could be “a critical tool to accelerate the transition that we need.”

Peter Styring, director of the UK Centre for Carbon Dioxide Utilization and professor of chemical engineering and chemistry at the University of Sheffield, told attendees during an afternoon session that industry needs to begin viewing atmospheric carbon as a resource rather than a pollutant. One key step, he said, is using policy to encourage companies to harvest and use carbon dioxide that is already in the atmosphere, rather than separately pulling carbon from the fossil fuels that are in the ground. New policies would create new innovations and industries, enable them to scale, and help curb the effects of climate change. He said there are only two ways to scale new technologies to meet climate goals.

“One is for industry to embrace the technologies and invest in changing [existing] technologies; the second is for government to put a policy push in place to ensure that [such a transition] is allowed to happen,” said Styring.

An existing market is key for startups, said Gay Wyn Quance, whose company, Solid Carbon Products, uses waste carbon dioxide gas from industry and other sources to make materials, like carbon nanofiber. Quance said the business is already profitable but a strong market for recycled carbon would help it thrive and enable the company to produce mass amounts of goods using waste carbon. Andrew Bocarsly, a professor of chemistry ar Princeton, said there is so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and different ways to convert it into various molecules, that carbon utilization technologies represent an opportunity for lots of industries and companies.

Gregory Nemet, professor of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the speed at which new technologies are scaled is also important. Solar power is now transforming the electric grid in many ways, but he said, new technologies need to scale much faster than the solar industry scaled photovoltaics in order to move the needle on climate. Nemet said policymakers should also encourage the flow of knowledge around the world to not only spur technical innovation but, equally critical, to deploy the technologies globally.

Barry Rand, associate director for external partnerships at the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, said that meetings that engage diverse stakeholders are crucial for facilitating this knowledge exchange.

“That’s what we’re doing here — sharing information so that researchers, industry leaders and policymakers can find synergies and ways to bring technologies to market, and swiftly identify and overcome challenges,” said Rand, who is also an associate professor of electrical engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. “We’re working toward pragmatic solutions.”

The annual meeting was sponsored by Princeton E-ffiliates Partnership, a membership program that engages corporations to collaborate with academic experts to advance research and help move technology into the marketplace.
