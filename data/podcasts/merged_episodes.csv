Well, it comes from different places  So 90% of the water comes from two places to watersheds that combined are called the Catskill Delaware watershed or water system  I think, um, and then the other one from the Crow Crow didn't always want to say crow tone, but from the Croton Reservoir, that 10% is actually filtered  We'll get into all of that",a99e0858-6066-406d-9c85-c754b10bae33,"Getting the rain and melted snow from upstate NY into the taps of every NYC resident and business is one of the great feats of engineering.

Sure, but you're gonna have to have a lot more reasons than that to move to Arlington, Texas  Ouch  That when I'm not taking what are some of the problems that with New York water?

NYC Water: An Engineering Marvel," It's pathogens can cling to that sentiment, so it's not something you want suspended  Plus, it also makes it much more difficult to filter that stuff out  It's like extra work that has to be done to try to get rid of that settlement  And if you're not filtering your water to begin with, that's kind of a problem  Um, and then secondly, the other one is nutrients over  It's over nutrient, meaning it's just packed with bribe  Oh, Flavin  Well, what?

NYC Water: An Engineering Marvel," But there is fertilizer that goes downstream and runs into the watersheds  And phosphorus is one of the biggest problems because farmers do fertilize with phosphorus and if it runs off, the phosphorus alone is not great, cause it can cause algae blooms and stuff like that  And it can taste bad and stink because when the algae dies, it decays, and it does not smell good  Now it does not smell good, but, um ah, bigger problem, though, is when you combine that with the chlorine because, like we said, New York water is chlorinated in florid ated",a99e0858-6066-406d-9c85-c754b10bae33,"Getting the rain and melted snow from upstate NY into the taps of every NYC resident and business is one of the great feats of engineering.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," Now, before we get onto the wildly implausible but just recap  What is metaphysics? Metaphysics is the part of philosophy that studies reality  So a lot of philosophy is looking at man's place in the world, wondering what the universe it's metaphysics is the bit that really wonders what the universe is  So this is distinct from science in the olden days, if you go back three centuries or more messy physics was not distinct from science  They were very much intertwined, doing the same kind of thing",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," For in the 17th century onwards, you get a divergence, and now science tends to study the physical material world  But metaphysics thinks that there are a lot of questions open that science doesn't cover  So questions like what actually is the physical material world  That's a metaphysics  But what about the wildly implausible bit? So I spend most of my time working on the history of metaphysics on large parts of it are wildly implausible  They sound absolutely bonkers when he advice come across them  Nonetheless, I think they're really valuable to look at",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," If these theories are wildly implausible, what's the point of even thinking about them? One of the reasons I find them absolutely fascinating is that although the conclusion sound implausible? The arguments forthem can actually be really simple and compelling  Can you give an example? I can I can talk you through a couple  So let's start with a metaphysical view advanced by on Conway in the 16 seventies  Conway has a view that the whole universe, everything in it is alive  This view is known as vital ism, and I think that sounds implausible  First sight",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," We tend to think that we're alive and plants and animals are alive  Everything else in the world Hills, mountains, stars, planets are not alive and free philosophy  To say that they are sounds really peculiar  So I suppose there is a modern day version of that with a guy  Our hypothesis, the idea that the whole plan is to somehow live from the bits that seemed to be dead, just like thinking as and hear the parts of a bigger system",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," Yeah, Conway would definitely say the old universe is one big system, and she has a couple of different reasons for advancing that view  One big problem she's trying to answer is how we as conscious beings interact with our bodies  It seems like our minds or something special  They're different from the natural world  You know, we have this weird property of thinking and feeling, and that seems to be different from everything else around us",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," One advantage of saying everything in the world is alive is that you eliminate the question of how to things that are so different  Mind and matter can interact  So she's getting rid of that interaction problem entirely  Now you might well be thinking, Well, all right, fine  Let's get rid of that interaction problem  But why not just say everything is material? Surely that system plant's been saying everything is alive, and that's where her second argument comes in",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," Conway, back in the 17th century, is really worried about God's relationship with creation, as almost all European philosophers were back then  One question that Conway asks that almost no other philosopher asks is, How is it that God could create something different from himself? God, we assume, is a living, thinking, conscious, being matter  The stuff of tables and chairs and mountains and stars isn't any of those things, and Conway think that leads to another interaction problem between God, who's living in thinking and matter which is not living",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," I'm not thinking so by making everything in the world alive, she's eliminating that second interaction problem as well  God can create living things because we are like him  But that seems weird in another way because traditionally, God created the earth and created non living things as well as living things  So in standard Christian metaphysics, you'd assume that the release two kinds of things around in the world because God made them  For most Christians for era, the Bible would have been providing the premises from which you argue",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," It seems to me that the premises within the Bible actually lead to at least a dualism of stuff  Conway would say The Bible doesn't write anything about dualism  The Bible tells us that God creates the living things that move upon the earth on the mountains, on the stars  But the Bible says nothing about what they're made off, whether their material or physical  And so Conway thinks matter  Physics is fully compatible with these biblical stories",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," And what's more, she thinks that it's an improvement upon the traditional philosophies of her time because she gets to say that God, this grand living being would never create anything dead interesting  Now, presumably from some perspectives, this is an advance on the kind of Cartesian dualism that would have been pretty much prevalent in her day  So for those people who are materialists, it's sort of a step in the right direction because there's only one kind of stuff  Yeah, absolutely",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," So back in the 17th century, almost all everyone was a Cartesian duelist from the 16 forties onwards, and Conway thinks that Jewel is, um, is riddled with problems  Both of these interaction problems being some of them, and she can fix that  Her metaphysics is preferable to day cots, so in this case, she's got a wildly implausible conclusion  But what you're interested in is how she arrived in conclusion  Why, yes, absolutely  And I think that how she arrived at that conclusion on why I find the arguments there really simple and there will stay compelling",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," Let's consider another example then  Well, if you like, we could consider pans  I give him as another example  So Pan Sikhism was resurrected in the 19 twenties by the philosopher and physicist Arthur Eddington, sees a British physicist and philosopher best known for its physics, but also and too deep into metaphysical territory, and Eddington advances really again simple and compelling argument for pan psych ism  So Eddington is looking at the world that science tells him about, and he thinks that we never have direct access to the world around us",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," What we have access to you are readings on scientific instruments  He describes these instruments as dials  He talks about how we only have pointed readings, that point of being the little arrow on a dial that points to one number  Another, Eddington thinks that we don't have access to the nature of reality  As it is, we just have access to these measurements to these signs and symbols of reality",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," But that leads Addington to ask, What is the nature of reality? And his suggestion is, the only thing we really know about reality is that it contains conscious beings like us  So he looks inside his head  He finds a conscious being  He doesn't know what's outside his head  He's only got thes pointer readings, thes signs and symbols that he thinks maybe what's inside my head is a clue to what's outside  So maybe everything else that out there is conscious as well on this argument depends  Sikhism became really popular",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," Lots of people didn't like it, but lots of people did  But maybe it's not a clue to what's outside  That's equally possible  It is possible  But if you have no other information than making an inference from the data that you do have to the data that you don't is something that we do all the time  We don't know what the far side of the universe is like, but we assume it's gonna be something like the part that we live in  So because I speak English, I seem that they speak English in India",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," Yeah, if you didn't have any data about what language people spoke in other places, that seems like a reasonable inference to make  It's not a knockdown argument in the sense that you might be wrong about  And maybe Eddington is wrong about this part of reality that he doesn't have access to  But it seems like a sensible suggestion, even if all the dials air coherently telling me a story that seems to imply that there are physical objects, not just mental objects",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," If the Dial's could tell that story, then sure, then his suggestion that everything out there is conscious would seem to be ill founded  But Eddington would argue the dials are telling him any such thing  The dials air telling him how hot something is, how big something is, how quick it's moving  Dials can tell us all those same things about human beings on we're still conscious  So it's not obviously the case that your scientific readings can tell you what the nature of the real world is like",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," Eddington would say that when we're interacting with tables and chairs were not actually interacting with the true stuff that they really are  So he would say a table seems to be a solid, hard resistant surface  But the reality is that this table is composed of atoms with gigantic gaps between them that the table is mostly empty space  Sometimes he talks about Werling, vortis, ease of force that that's really what happens when you push down on a table  So he'd want to say, we just don't have access to reality as it really is",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," In the early 18th century, the Scottish philosopher David Hume advanced the view that we have no itself now, up until Hume, Western philosophers always assumed that I am a kind of being that has some kind of unchangeable core and that that cool persists over time  And maybe it changes from moment to moment  So you might think that I'm wondering around London right now I'm acquiring the memories  I'm having different thoughts and feelings  But inside me there is an Emily Nous that doesn't change  That is merely acquiring changing properties",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

Emily Thomas on Wildly Implausible Metaphysics," And that view, I think, is really widely held back then and today  That's why we tend to think it makes sense to talk about Emily of five years ago, when Emily of Five minutes ago, because there is some court Emily Nous that's there  Hume comes along and says, Hang on a second  Let's look inside ourselves and see whether we actually introspect or perceive any core Emily Nous and Hume says that we don't when we look inside ourselves  Well, we perceive are fleeting thoughts and feelings",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Some philosophers have drawn very strange conclusions about the nature of reality.

James Wilson," In some cases, there may be something to that  James Rachel's has a classic thought experiment involving two people, Smith and Jones, and he's interested in Is there really a different tree, actively killing somebody and letting them die? And so he sets up to precisely matched cases where the only difference is that in one case, as a killing in another case letting die and most people think that Okay, yes  In that particular scenario, constructed there doesn't seem to be a moral difference between killing and letting die",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Are thought experiments the best way of doing practical ethics?

James Wilson, But the questions what follows from that does it follow that there's never a difference between killing and letting die?

Are they a distraction from real world ethics?

James Wilson," What they're doing is scientific, but you need to look very closely at the way that, for example, randomized clinical trials are used in testing for drug safety, a well designed clinical trial  It will tell you something about the effect of that drug on the particular trial population  But the particular trial population will often be quite specific  And it may be different from the people who actually finally want to use the drug to help",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Are thought experiments the best way of doing practical ethics?

Perhaps the best way to start thinking about it is to think about the way in which possible worlds were introduced into philosophy, which having a really long time ago  So Gottfried Lightning, it's in the late 17th early 18th century, very famously said that we live in the best of all possible worlds",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Helen Beebee on Possible Worlds," And he did say that typically the response he got to expressing that belief was we called the incredulous stare, and he was worried about whether the incredulous stare kind of counted as an argument  Like those distances have any weight in philosophical arguments about this, Lewis's view was, Look, they're an incredibly useful device, not just for understanding modality, but a whole range of other things  And his line was when something's that used for, you should just believe in it  He made the analogy with sets in mathematics is it sets a really strange thing, right?

To say that some sentences collectively a consistent with each other, is just to say that they can't all be true together, and the idea of they can't all be true together  It's possible for the more to be true together  That's just another motile notion  So his worrywarts, we haven't really filtered out all the modality  If we do the exact his story, we're still left with this primitive notion of what's possible and what's necessary",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Philosophers often talk about possible worlds.

Paul Sagar on Scepticism about Philosophy," Yes, sir, there's two parts of what you said there that I think of both it very important that really need to be pulled apart  The first is the Aristotelian idea that there was something about living a moral life which is deeply connected to human happiness  And in some sense, that seems to be true  If we look around our world often they're cheats, the liars, the frauds  These people don't look very happy  They might get rich, but they often look like they're losing something else Now",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Throughout its history there have been challenges to the status of philosophy.

Paul Sagar on Scepticism about Philosophy," Unfortunately, the flip side is that there's no guarantee the immorality leads to unhappiness, and there's certainly no guarantee that morality leads the happiness that seems to be a rough correlation between living a decent ethical life and being a relatively happy person  And Aristotle was one of the people who made this very clear  External luck can take all that away from you very, very quickly",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Throughout its history there have been challenges to the status of philosophy.

Paul Sagar on Scepticism about Philosophy," The other part of what you said there was that reason would be the key faculty through which we could discover this connection  Andi, That's somewhere that I, in the tradition of people like Bernie Williams, David Hume, great friend Adam Smith have been very skeptical that it's reason that's got anything to do with this",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Throughout its history there have been challenges to the status of philosophy.

Paul Sagar on Scepticism about Philosophy," But if there's a connection between living ethically and living happily, it probably lies in psychological dispositions, emotional regulation, having good friends, having a good community and reason is the faculty of being good at numbers and good arguments of logic chopping, and that's very useful and has all kinds of important things to do in human life  But it's not what's gonna connect ethical living to human flourishing  You've just been talking about your skepticism about what Phyllis we can do in the area of morals",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Throughout its history there have been challenges to the status of philosophy.

Paul Sagar on Scepticism about Philosophy, But what the Williams skepticism in this sort of Hume skepticism is more about is whether it's really the philosophy that's doing the work there  Whether it's the kinds of dispositions and emotional resonance is that people already had that maybe get pushed in a new direction by being exposed to some kinds of arguments  I certainly think it would be a mistake to say that philosophy is simply impotent or simply powerless,c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Throughout its history there have been challenges to the status of philosophy.

There's a certain kind of philosophical assumption in much mainstream Western philosophy that the point of moral philosophy is to find out the truth about moral questions  But a very different vision comes from Frederick Nietzsche, who's often held up to be the arch sceptic, the arts debunker  But in some ways he really wasn't because what nature's main concern Waas, when it came to morality, was the question of what is healthy",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,"Throughout its history there have been challenges to the status of philosophy.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," Right? So very often when we think about civility, we want toe link, it thio other concepts  Common courtesy  Often we define civility as a virtue that's akin to politeness  But one of the things I'm really interested in is the way that civility deviates from those other concepts and the particular peculiar features it has  Well, what are those features? What other differences between politeness and civility? Because they sound like synonyms to me  So one of them has already come up already  It's the fact that civility seems pertinent to disagreements in particular",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

But that's very different from harming them  The kind of trance to a male tradition of free speech  Yes, and those theorists who would want to push that point and say, Well, no, no, no  The virtue of civility is, is something else that's something low  But solid could point to an alternative history",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," But I, in my own work would want to argue that actually civility in the modern sense in the sense we touched on at the beginning as a conversational virtue pertinent to disagreement in particular dates slightly earlier  And it's a product of early modern debates about religious toleration that emerged precisely in that time, where the boundary between inside and outside the Civitas is more porous and is itself a subject of conflict  So who are the sources of this religious civility?

Teresa Bejan on Civility," It starts from trying to offer an account of who the inventors of modern incivility really were  So here  I think the most crucial figure is really Martin Luther himself  I mean, you might think of Martin Luther is kicking off the first modern crisis of civility 500 years ago because, in addition to making sophisticated theological arguments against the Catholic Church, he also decided to frame those arguments and to present them in such a way that was deliberately offensive to the social mores of his day",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," And so that's where I started and trying to theorize civility, really thinking about civility as the willingness to stay in the room and continue to engage with even the most deplorable of one's political opponents with the thought that disagreement itself is necessarily disagreeable  And nevertheless, it's better that we disagree that we fight our battles with words  Then we fight those battles with swords  But I can disagree forcefully with you, maybe offend you in the process without fighting you  There is a distinction still between words and blows",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," It's a distinction that I think increasingly is being put under pressure  If we think about Austin Ian, accounts of language and a lot of contemporary theories of hate speech and sexist speech would say, Well, no words are actions, Words do wound and words do this essential work of creating and maintaining social hierarchies and status differentials",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," So what really interested me in looking to the 16th and 17th centuries for a theory of what I would call mere civility as this kind of minimal, conversational virtue that makes difficult disagreements possible is that in that period, no one ever would have made the case that oh well, disagreement is okay because words don't really matter Anyway  There's a strong sense of the importance of language and the importance of the word  So the word of God, the gospel as something that must flow freely in society  So the question really becomes",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," How do you have difficult disagreements in a tolerant society without that society falling apart and collapsing into civil war? You introduced this notion of mere civility  Could you just freshen that out a little bit? Tell us what it means So mere civility I would define as a minimal conformity to social norms of respectful behavior, and specifically, it's the minimum necessary to keep the conversation going  But you can tell right there from that definition that the particular demands of civility or mere civility in any given conversation be highly context dependent and highly audience dependent",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," So instead of fixating or focusing on rules of civil conduct, the appropriate way to doff your hat where the appropriate ceremonial language or the way that we address or, you know, express deference to others instead we sort of think about civility as a prudential or practical judgment about what's required in a given conversation with a given conversationalist so that conversation can continue",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," But then it has this other element, which is that it remains committed also to telling the truth to our interlocutors, and part of that truth will often be telling them what we really think of them  And they're execrable views  So we're civility  One way of thinking about it is a commitment both not pulling our punches, but also to not landing them all at once so that the conversation can continue between combatants",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," I can see that Prudential Ia's you say this could be a great virtue to cultivate But I would suggest it's not a widely distributed virtue at the moment  And many people seem psychologically incapable off doing what you're suggesting when it comes to discussing matters that are really important to them, right? It would seem today that civility, and especially mirror civility, is a virtue and critically short supply  It's also a time in which the critique of civility is increasingly powerful  So we see this in the context of American politics today",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," The thought that in the face of gross injustice, civility isn't a virtue it all  It's just a demand for deference from the powerful to an unjust status quo  What worries me then, as a proponent of civility is the propensity of some people who call for civility to try to turn it into this kind of aspirational elite and sort of gentlemanly virtue that says, Oh, do but be civil right  Let's have a civil conversation",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," And in mistaking civility firm or demanding conversational virtues, more elite and elitist conversational virtues like politeness like deference, we risk crowding out the more low but solid and minimalist ground of mere civility that's really necessary for disagreement to be possible in a tolerant society  You mentioned your conversion from being a civility skeptic to being pro civility",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.

Teresa Bejan on Civility," How is this change your behavior? My post conversion experience has been that I've become really sensitive to the ways in which incivility and uncivil disagreement lead to a really pernicious process of people retreating into the more agreeable company off the like minded, right? So one thing I always like to point out to my students is that there's a reason that disagreeable is a synonym for unpleasant  It's much nicer to talk to people who we can be confident, agree with us already  But that's a disaster in a tolerant society  It's a disaster in a democracy",c52feda9-2191-4692-b8ec-3bd788a436ee,Civility is a conversational virtue that governs how people talk to each other.
